Project description:
Bars, bookstores, art and community spaces where LGBTQ women gather are closing their doors, and women are being forced out of the neighborhoods where the few spaces remain. Why is this happening, what’s being lost, and what are some spaces doing to stay open despite the odds?

ALL WE’VE GOT (formerly the Unknown Play Project) is a documentary film project looking at the disappearance of physical spaces where lesbians and queer women gather and seeks to understand what makes some spaces resilient in the face of so much change.

Join us as we travel the country to find answers to these questions and more.
